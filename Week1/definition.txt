Business Process Management (BPM) is the practice of analyzing, designing, and improving workflows so they are organized, efficient, and easy to repeat. It helps save time and ensures better results for both employees and customers.
Employees often spend too much time searching for the correct forms, which slows down service requests and work efficiency.
Suppliers: Customer service team, IT department
Inputs: Request forms, customer details
Process: Receive request → Check details → Route to department → Track progress
Outputs: Completed service request
Customers: End customer, service team
